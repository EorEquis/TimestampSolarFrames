# TimestampSolarFrames
I wanted to timestamp frames in solar animations. 

SharpCap can include timestamp in video filename, which AutoStakkert keeps, so the time of each animation frame is available.

This script extracts the time from the filename, and annotates it on the image itself.

Example of the end result.
